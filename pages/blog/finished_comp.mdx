# Finished Comprehensive Exam
---
## Comprehensive Exam, 9 May

The second major obstacle in the Math PhD program here is the comprehensive exam. This is an oral exam with a sylabbus designed incoordination with you advisor. The main topics that were on my syllabus were homology (singular homology, cellular homology and computations, cohomology, universal coefficient theorem, etc.) and Reimannian Geometry (general definitions and properties, connections, geodesics, Levi-Civita connection, etc.). My comp started with me giving a talk on Floer Homology and its use in proving the Arnold Conjecture, and then the comittee asked me questions about the other topics. I could have done better answering these, but all in all I think it went okay and I was glad to have passed.

## Turkey Rocks, 20-21 May

Sierra and I spend a weekend in Woodland Park, CO climbing at Turkey Rocks which has beautiful splitter cracks. This is me preparing some gear for sending Gobble Up (5.8, hand/fist/offwidth) and Steppenwolf (5.9, offwidth/thin hands), the two prominent cracks in front of me.
