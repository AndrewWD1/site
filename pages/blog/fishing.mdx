# Fishing

I have been kind of interested in fishing since going with my brother a couple times and going with my Father-in-law once. I wasn't super stoked on it at first, but have found it to be a fun little diversion and a great way to get out and enjoy a place. 

I like keeping it pretty simple, just the rod/reel/line, some flies, and thats realy it. I don't have waiders, and this can really limit where I'm able to fish, but I love the simplicity of it. If I were to do it again I might consider getting a tenkara line to keep things really simple, but I really kind of just inherited my setup from my brother who fishes quite a bit and knows much more than I do.

I'm very happy to have found a spot that I really love to fish, thats small enough to cast from the bank, that isn't too far of a drive and was happy to have a caught a nice little trout in it a couple days ago.
