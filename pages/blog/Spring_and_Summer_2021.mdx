# Spring and Summer 2021

## Skiing Quandary Peak, May 14

<Image src={quandary} className={styles.image} alt="Quandary" />

Since the semester ended I have had a few good oppurtunities to get outside and ski. On May 14th I was able ski Quandary Peak with Jake in the Tenmile Range. Quandary is 14,271 feet, and very popular with hikers later in the summer. Late spring is an opportune time to ski Quandary as the heavy "Upslope" storms have blanketed the eastern mountains of Colorado, and warm temps have stabilized avalanche conditions to a degree. We skied the East Ridge which is the primary hiking route. It is an easy ski line, and made for a good 2500 feet of skiing along with a bit of hiking in our ski boots near the trailhead. This is just the second 14er I have made it to the top of, the other being a simple hike up Mount Bierstadt, and my first time skiing a 14er. Below you will see a 'fatmap' look at our route which I traced using my gps watch.

## Backpacking trip to Jasper Lake, June 5-6

The next day, Sierra and I started a backpacking trip to Jasper Peak in the Indian Peak Wilderness. It was only a five mile hike to our campsite, but it constisted of a lot of post-holing through intermittent snow that made the hike quite difficult. We got to the campsite and there was light rain that cleared up relatively quickly. We started late in the day, around 2pm, so by the time we got to our campsite it was dinner time. We made dinner, and then not to shortly after got in our sleeping bags to get some sleep. The next morning we woke up to clear skies, but that slowly changed with some cloud cover rolling in. The hike out was much easier than the hike in, though there was still lots of post-holing.

## Skiing Mount Toll, June 11

On 11 June, Levi and I skied Mount Toll (12,979'). We wanted to time conditions correctly, and our planning had us leaving the trailhead at 4:30 am. Unfortunately the gate was not yet open, so we waited until 5 for the gate to open, parked about a mile further up, and started hiking about 10 minutes later. We hiked (post-holed) in ski boots the whole way (minus about 100 feet of ill-advised skinnning.) The snow was very firm which is great as it meant lower avalanche risk, but we were quickly wondering whether we made the right choice to not bring an ice-axe or crampons. Luckily, the June sun worked its magic by the time it mattered and conditions turn out to be quite nice for booting up the Southeast Face of Mount Toll. We skied about 1453 feet of great soft snow. Unfortunately I forgot to start my gps watch for the trip, but below I outlined an approximate route that you can see in fatmap.

## Trail Ridge Road, June 18

Levi and I skied some small lines (~300 feet) off of Trail Ridge Road in RMNP. Incredibly warm weather in the Front Range had caused conditions to rapidly deteriorate and so there really isn't much good skiing left anywhere. I have gotten kind of attached to the idea of doing 'Turns All Year' now, which is seeing how many months in a row you can ski, and so I will probably have to get creative/desperate to find any snow to ski in August and September.

## Small Chutes Near Niwot Ridge, June 23

Levi and I skied some small chutes (~400 feet) on a flank of Niwot Ridge above Long Lake. The air was smoky due to some fires that have already started a bit west of here.

## Buffalo Mountain Hike, June 25

Unfortunaly hurt my bike lifting, so I am sticking to hiking for a bit. I hiked Buffalo Mountain near Frisco. Its a mountain that I really like because it has a great ski line on it called the Silver Couloir that I hope to ski at some point.

## Mount Parnassus Hike, June 27

This is another hike I was motivated to do mostly because I like this area for skiing. I have skied in Watrous Gulch and on the flank of Woods Mountain which are both accessed from this area. It rained on my drive up, but had cleared up a bit by the time I got to the trailhead. There was no rain for the rest of the hike, although the summit was very foggy.

## Mount Elbert Hike, June 29

Mount Elbert is the largest peak in Colorado, but to summit it is actually quite simple since it is just a normal hike. I left the house at 3:45am in order to try to get to the trailhead around 6am. I arrived only to find out there was a road clouse 1 mile from the actual trailhead. I got started from the road closure at 6:10am. There were clouds hanging over the mountain all morning, which meant most of the hiking was done in fog. On the summit, a group had brought two dogs up with them one of which was blind. For the first time I saw a ptarmigan! On the hike back down I also saw two bears on the trail who ran off when I made some noise cracking a tree branch. I made it back to the car at noon.

## Mount Edwards, July 13

I hiked Mount Edwards (13,850') from Argentine Pass Trailhead. It was mostly just an easy, unneventful hike and my main motivation for picking this hike was to see Horseshie Basin. Unfortunately it was quite hazy out from some fires out west.

## Saint Mary's Glacier, July 15

In order to get July turns in, I did an easy day out on Saint Mary's Glacier. THe trail was jam packed with people, including one wizard, but the turns were fairly good for July. I made two runs down the glacier, each about 500' in elevation.

## Turkey Rocks and Elevnmile Canyon Climbing, July 18-19

Sierra and I went climbing in the South Platte this weekend at Turkey Rocks and Elevenmile Canyon. I lead a few easy 5.7s at Turkey rocks and we top-roped a few harder climbs.
