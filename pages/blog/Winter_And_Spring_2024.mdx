# Winter and Spring 2024

## Best day of season so far

Got out with Joe Feb 4, 2024 to take advantage of the weekend storm. We had originally planned to get out to RMNP, but the storm tracked a bit farther south. Seeing 14" reported at Winter Park we decided on Berthoud Pass. It was the right call. We got out into a new (to us) zone, and it seemed to be the right call for the day as we had an incredible day with endless laps. The sun was warm, winds were soft if blowing at all, snow was light and deep. The only thing I could have wanted was to be in better shape, but I am slowly building up cardio again and big days like this will do a lot for later in the season.

## Feb 11th

Another great day out. Got out into a new zone with Jake. Didn't really know what to expect, and thought there was a possibility the snow wouldn't be great. We got to the top of our run, and had out first look at the ski conditions and the snow seemed to have an odd texture from wind

It actually skied really well though. We were lucky to have hit this zone when we did though, since under the 4 or 5 inches of soft new snow on top there was a very strong sun crust burried. This was to be expected though, and this would be a great place to ski on an average winter day.

## Spring

A very nice start to spring, though I am now dealing with pain in my sacroiliac joint so taking it easy for a bit. 

Have enjoyed doing some reading with our dog on rainy days on our porch.

This might be my favorite time for fishing in Boulder Canyon: before the spring meltoff has completely began so that flows are still very low in the river, but nice crisp, sunny, cool days. The fish are crushing small nymphs on the dry-dropper.

The day before hurting my pelvis I was lucky to have a beautiful day to ski Coon Hill in Summit County. A perfect spring warmup lap for the remainder of the ski season, although now I might be on the sidlines for a few weeks.
