# Winter 2024

## Best day of season so far

Got out with Joe Feb 4, 2024 to take advantage of the weekend storm. We had originally planned to get out to RMNP, but the storm tracked a bit farther south. Seeing 14" reported at Winter Park we decided on Berthoud Pass. It was the right call. We got out into a new (to us) zone, and it seemed to be the right call for the day as we had an incredible day with endless laps. The sun was warm, winds were soft if blowing at all, snow was light and deep. The only thing I could have wanted was to be in better shape, but I am slowly building up cardio again and big days like this will do a lot for later in the season.
