# Functors

My goal here is for you to walk away with an understanding of what functors from a mathematics viewpoint, and why they are a useful pattern for understanding code. They are actually a very simple construct, and this is actually why they show up all over. If they seem confusing to you, you might not be thinking *simply enough*.

## Categories 

First, to gain a mathematicians viewpoint of functors we must get comfortable with the idea of a "Category." Mathematicians study mathematical structures, and frequently they are singling out only one type of structure for consideration. For example, someone might be interestedin a property of sets. In this case, they care about the category SET.
